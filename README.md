# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

# Objective
To build a simple machine learning model that predicts house prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, and age of the house.

# Dataset
A small offline dataset containing house features and corresponding prices.

# Steps Followed
1. Loaded the dataset into Pandas.
2. Performed feature scaling using StandardScaler.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a Linear Regression model.
5. Evaluated the model using MAE and RMSE.
6. Visualized actual vs predicted house prices.

# Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

# How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
2. Run:
   python main.py

# Results
The model shows a strong linear relationship between actual and predicted house prices with low prediction error.
